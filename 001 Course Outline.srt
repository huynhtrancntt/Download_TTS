00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,536
Hello and welcome back

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:04,352
Let's dive into everything this course has in store

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,912
Google kick things off with introduction

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:11,520
We cannot discuss why moving beyond the default selenium library is beneficial

5
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:17,920
Then we will explore what selenium base is and how it stands out compared to the standard selenium

6
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:22,784
Following that we'll see how brightest Works in tandem with selenium base

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,880
After laying the groundwork we will jump into setting up our envir

8
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,464
We'll start by installing Python and setting up by

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,024
Covering both Macos and window

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,352
We will discuss the importance of virtual environment

11
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,912
And get everything ready to install selenium base

12
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,472
Then comes the exciting

13
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,264
Which is writing our first

14
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,568
Will get grips with the test

15
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,616
Next understand how it operates

16
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,408
And how differs from selenium

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,504
Will intentionally fill a test to examine the assertions and error

18
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:58,880
Only on we will push a changes to GitHub which is crucial for tracking progress in your project

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,208
As you become a doctor crafting basic

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,512
Will dive into selenium base command

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,120
Will cover range of assertions provided by selenium bass and pee test

22
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,680
Followed by a deep dive into weight

23
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,264
Including the commonly used implicit and explicit

24
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,104
Next we'll tackle different web elements like sliders

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
Please drop

26
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,920
Is checkbox iframes and more

27
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,992
It will also learn to open an interact with new

28
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,320
From there we will discover how to upload file

29
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,624
Both individually and in batch

30
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,976
Will explore how to manage file Parts effectively for file upload

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,584
As we grow comfortable with testing will start building a framework

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
Beginning with the page object model

33
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,704
Converting existing test and setting up a config

34
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,544
Will also integrate winter and file formatter into a framework

35
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,616
Then we going to move on to some Advanced topics

36
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,944
That is how you can go ahead and optimize your framework

37
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,992
We will do that by using hug

38
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
Data driven

39
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
And utility

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,624
Will you find a test as well as a framework

41
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:07,232
We will also learn how to execute the selectively focusing on specific groups

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
Excluding others as needed

43
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,376
When is Spotify Advanced concept we're going to take a look at how we can

44
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,400
Play skilled the framework

45
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:19,520
This is where we will Embrace parallel testing cross browser testing and headless run

46
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
Who

47
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
Speed and efficiency

48
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,384
Then we're going to move on to debug

49
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,688
This is where we going to cover the Bas

50
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,736
And learn about PDP Trace mode

51
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,832
Before moving on to more Advanced Techniques such as with by John Denver

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,440
Then we will take a look at how to review and generate insightful reports

53
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,768
Including selenium bass Auto generated logs and dashboard

54
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,376
Additionally we will also see how we can combine Parts HTML reports

55
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,168
With the selenium is Dash

56
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,520
Singapore's final stages will integrate a

57
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
Cast with Seattle

58
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
Will set up linters and format

59
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,992
All of that as part of a CF pipal

60
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,856
Then we will bring browserstack into the mix for Crossroads the testing as well as cross device

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,720
And to tie all of it together we going to integrate GitHub actions with browser

62
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
Connect for the seamless end to end testing

63
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,352
As you can tell we have a lot to cover over here

64
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:21,728
But rest assured for the schools I will be here to provide personal support whenever you need it

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,032
Ensuring you get the most out of your
